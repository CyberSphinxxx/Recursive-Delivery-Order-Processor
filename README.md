# Recursive Delivery Order Processor

## Overview
This system efficiently manages deliveries by collecting order information and their corresponding delivery addresses.

It prompts the user to input the number of orders, then proceeds to gather the name and address for each order. After all orders are entered, it presents a comprehensive list of orders along with their respective addresses.

The system's efficient processing is facilitated by recursion, a powerful technique that handles each delivery one by one until all orders are successfully processed.

## Features
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting order details
- Dynamic handling of variable numbers of orders
- Clear presentation of orders and their delivery addresses
- Utilizes recursion for efficient order processing

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Follow the prompts to input order details.
4. Once all orders are entered, the system will display a list of orders and their addresses.
