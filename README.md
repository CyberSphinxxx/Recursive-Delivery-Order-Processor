# Recursive-Delivery-Order-Processor
A system for managing deliveries. It asks for the number of orders, then asks for each order's name and delivery address. Once all orders are entered, it displays a list of orders along with their addresses. It uses a technique called recursion to handle each delivery one by one until all orders are processed.
